# Automatically create products in Shopify using Google Sheets and OpenAI APIs

This is inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IPu4OAIA69g) that shows a cool integration between Google Sheets, OpenAI and Shopify.

The video goes on to show,
1. Read new product information from a row of a Google Sheet
2. Call OpenAI text generation API to generate a description for the product based on the title
3. Call OpenAI image generation API to generate a product image
4. Call Shopify API to create a new product

This is a Ballerina program that does the same.

This is written as an HTTP service. Also possible to write this as a webhook listener that listens to a new row addition in Google Sheets and creates products in Shopify.
